Hey Noah, welcome to week 1 feedback!

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

## Feedback

Good Work!

- look into installing a code formatter like Prettier to help keep the indentation of the html elements consistent
- the hellWorld.js file had a console.log present, however, in the index.html file it needs to be placed in a `<script>` element in the `<head>` section; ex, `<script src="helloWorld.js"></script>`
- this pic was great, but for it to be sourced correctly, `<img src="../Cornman.jpeg" height="300" width="300" />`. this is due to the location of the image file in respect to the index file.

We also love giving feedback on things you are curious about, so feel free to throw questions you have into the comments on your assignment.

Keep up the good work!

--Resubmit work completed! Using the Developer tools in Google Chrome will be a lifesaver going forward. Always check/recheck code for errors. Nice work correcting your work.
