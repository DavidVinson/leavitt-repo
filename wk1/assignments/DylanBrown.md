Hey Dylan, welcome to week 1 feedback!

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

## Feedback

Good Work!

- Images are a bugger! Ensure the project has access to your image, ex: `<img src="../images/MY-IMAGE.png" width="300" height="300">` otherwise the image will be missing. In the case that the image is missing, it is a good practice to add the `alt` property and give a value like `alt='my-image-pic'`, or something that describes the image.

We also love giving feedback on things you are curious about, so feel free to throw questions you have into the comments on your assignment.

Great work!
