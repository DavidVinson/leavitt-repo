Hey Jaylyn, welcome to week 1 feedback!

To set a little context, even if everything is amazing, we always give feedback on how we think you could improve - there's no such thing as perfect code, and there's always room for improvement.

### Notes:

It may help taking another look into the commands. It may take a little more practice, but getting used to the above commands will come in handy. The good thing is that after a few repetitious practice sessions of these commands, you will have them down.

## Feedback

Overall, really good work! It will take some more practice, but that is what it is all about.

- look into installing a code formatter like Prettier to help keep the indentation of the html elements consistent
- maybe look to add the header to the css file and target the `<header>` element directly. Pretty much like the `<footer>` element. Nesting the header in a div is not wrong, but just to be aware that there may be more div elements in a file and this could lead to unexpected results.
- this might have just been overlooked, but we were looking for the JS file to contain a `console.log('Hello World')`. Using the console.log() function will become your best friend when trying to debug code.
- take some time to review the command line and git commands.

We also love giving feedback on things you are curious about, so feel free to throw questions you have into the comments on your assignment.

Great work!

### Resubmitted work

- nice work on working through the errors. learning the command line and git commands gets better with practice!
