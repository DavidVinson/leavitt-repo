### Notes:

- be mindful of naming the css classes the same as an html element. for example, there is the '''<head>''' section, yet there is a .head class named in the css file. In small projects, you could probably get away with this, but larger projects this could get confusing. best to be a little more clear, or descriptive in your css classes.

## Feedback

- Get into habit of smaller commits. Yes, the amount of code that is changing is not much; work on the commit messages as well. More descriptive in what/why the code is changing. Nice Work!
