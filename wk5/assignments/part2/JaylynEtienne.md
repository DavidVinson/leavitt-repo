### Notes:

- ''' background-image: url('/Users/jaylynetienne/week5/eda-pw-week-5-assignment-part-2/assignment/record.png');'''. This will work on your own machine, but any other machine will not have access to this local folder. therefore, the image will not get rendered. look into how to reference images within a project. hint: must use the relative path to the image. since the stylesheet.css and the record.png are at the same folde level, how would you reference the recored.png in the stylesheet.css?

## Feedback

- Good amount of commits, but now start getting more descriptive in "what/why" a change has occurred. A short descriptive commit message gives a clearer picture of how the code has been changed. Nice work!
