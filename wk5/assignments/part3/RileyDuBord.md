## Feedback

- You _could_ start to add more comments to your code though. A lot is said here through the console.logs and naming of functions and variables. However it is common professionally to add comments before functions to explain their inputs, output, and purpose.

- Nice work on testing the functions!

- Overall, very clean and organized code. Good tests provide confidence in what should be expected from functions.
