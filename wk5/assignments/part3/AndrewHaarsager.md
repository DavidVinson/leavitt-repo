Notes on items above.

## Feedback

- Good code comments throughout! This helps not only the developer, but any addtional developers who may read the code. Great use to see if a function is doing what it should be doing and keeping track of different versions of a function. Well done!

- Keeping functions small and focused on one job is a good practice. I'm referring to the 'displayTracks' function.

- Nice use of the console.table function.

- Way to challenge yourself in testing and refactoring functions to handle more work. Another challenge will be to keep your functions from doing too much.
