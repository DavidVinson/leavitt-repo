### Notes:

Nice work on the Weekend Challenge! Way to refactor and get everything working. Complexity naturally happens, just keep simplicity in mind then add complexity. Really enjoy the animations! yes, that would be like burning money if the total montly got that far out of hand, at least if you're not Google!

### HTML:

- The code commits are descriptive, but larger projects should have a few more commits.
- The HTML document is well formed and organized. Good use of targeting an element by an id.

### CSS:

- Incorporating flex-box is a great way to ensure the page looks good on various size screens.
- centering the form and table looks more finished, good job.
- look to style the buttons as well!

### JS:

- the user cannot be trusted! ha! keep form and input field validation and user feedback as something that has to be taken into account.
- on most forms, after a successful submit, the fields would be cleared.
