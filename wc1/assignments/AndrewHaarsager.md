### Notes:

Nice work on the Weekend Challenge! The end site was easy to use and read. Form and input validation can make or break an app, way to keep user validation in mind.

### HTML:

- The code commits are descriptive, but larger projects should have a few more commits.
- The HTML document is well formed and organized. Good use of targeting an element by an id.

### CSS:

- Great use of css variables for the colors!
- Incorporating flex-box is a great way to ensure the page looks good on various size screens.
- maybe try centering the form and the table on the page. this is nit picky, but it may look a little more finished.

### JS:

- Nice use of an alert to show user that the form was not submitted and to complete all fields.
- Way to keep an input field with data when it was filled out correctly, but other fields were empty. Less typing for the user.
- The form and inputs are well guarded with validation. The id check is really good as this should be unique.
