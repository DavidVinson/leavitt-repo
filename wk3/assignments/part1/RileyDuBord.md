| 1. Favorite Foods Array created and logged                     |     y     |
| 2. Used `.length` property to find array length                |     y     |
| 3.a Logged second item (index 1) in animal array               |     y     |
| 3.b Logged last item (index 3) in animal array                 |     y     |
| 3.c STRETCH Logged last item (length y 1) in animal array      |     y     |
| 4.a Used `.push()` to add item to end of array                 |     y     |
| 4.b Used `.unshift()` to add item to beginning of array        |     y     |
| 4.c Used `.pop()` to remove the item from end of array         |     y     |
| 4.d Used `.shift()` to remove the item from beginning of array |     y     |
| 5.a STRETCH Replaced the second item in the gem array          |     y     |
| 5.b STRETCH Sorted and reversed the gem array                  |     y     |
| 5.c STRETCH Joined the gem array into a string                 |     y     |
| 5.d STRETCH Combined the color array with the gem array        |     y     |

### Notes:

- Just a note on 5b: There is a simpler way to sort() and reverse() and array using built-in array methods. built-in array functions are able to be chained togther, ex 'gems.sort().reverse()'

## Feedback

- Nice work on the number of commits, now work on smaller commits with more direct message for what was changed. This will help when the code gets larger. For example, a change was made by sorting and reversing an array. commit message may read "sorted and reversed gems array".

- Great work overall!
