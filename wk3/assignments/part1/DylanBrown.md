## Feedback

- Your commits are great! Small and decriptive commits are a better practice than one, or two large commits. Keep it up!

- I would like to see you give the stretch goals a try as they are meant to provide a little more challenge or possibly encourage you to reference addtional materials to complete.

- Nice work!
