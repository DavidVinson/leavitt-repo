## Feedback

- Very detailed work! In the last commit, you made a correction for a missing ";". Just curious, was this a manual find, meaning that you went through the code and found the missing ";", OR did your formatter make this correction for you? Either way works just fine, but relying on the formatter is very handy in making corrections like this.

- Keep up the good work!
