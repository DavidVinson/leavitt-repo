## Feedback

- '''
  let firstColor = colors.shift();
  console.log("Removed the first color", firstAnimal);
  '''

  In the above code snippet, the variable that should have been logged is "firstColor" not "firstAnimal". Pay attention to the little details!

- Try committing changes more often. Small commits more often is a better practice than waiting and committing one, or two large commits. It allows to check less when looking back at what has changed in a file.

- Nice Work!
