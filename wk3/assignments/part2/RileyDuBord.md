### Notes:

- Just a note on 'for...of' loops. It is general practice when iterating through an array to use a singular noun.
  'for (let starNames of stars) {
  console.log(starNames);
  }'
  could rename to 'for (let star of stars) {...}'

  The code works, it is just helps with identifying the iterator is 'one' item.

| General Items                       | Complete? |

| GitHub config correct               |     y     |
| At least 3 commits                  |     y     |
| Code is correctly formatted         |     y     |
| Appropriate amount of code comments |     y     |

## Feedback

- Nice work on the number of commits, now work on smaller commits with more direct message for what was changed. This will help when the code gets larger. For example, a change was made by sorting and reversing an array. commit message may read "sorted and reversed gems array".
