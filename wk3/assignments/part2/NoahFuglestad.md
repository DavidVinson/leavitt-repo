### Notes:

- 2a: the loops is good, but the exercise was to make it a 'for...of' loop.

| General Items                       | Complete? |
| ----------------------------------- | :-------: |
| GitHub config correct               |     y     |
| At least 3 commits                  |     y     |
| Code is correctly formatted         |     y     |
| Appropriate amount of code comments |     y     |

## Feedback

- Try committing changes more often. Small commits more often is a better practice than waiting and committing one, or two large commits. It allows to check less when looking back at what has changed in a file. Committing smaller changes allows for specific commit messages.

- Formatting is looking good

- Nice work with all the loops! Question 2a was to be written as a 'for...of' loop.
