  '''for (let star of stars) {
  }
  console.log('Some stars:', stars );
  '''

## Feedback

- Try committing changes more often. Small commits more often is a better practice than waiting and committing one, or two large commits. It allows to check less when looking back at what has changed in a file. Committing smaller changes allows for specific commit messages.
  - I see the additional commits! Form the habit after any change that works, commit early and commit often!
