### Notes:

- 2a: 'for (star of stars){
  console.log(star);
  }'

- When we use a for...of loop, we need to declare the new variable that represents each thing in the array:
  `for (let star of stars) {...}` Just like when we have for loops, we write `for (let i = 0;...)`

When you write `for (let star of stars)` without the `let`, you technically make a secret global `var`!

## Feedback

- Try committing changes more often. Small commits more often is a better practice than waiting and committing one, or two large commits. It allows to check less when looking back at what has changed in a file.

- Nice work!
