## Feedback

- Q2.a: Nice work on declaring the interative variable in the for...of loop. Even though it would work without, ex. "for (i of stars) {...}", it is a better habit to declare the variable.

- When you write `for (i of stars)` without the `let`, you technically make a secret global `var`!
