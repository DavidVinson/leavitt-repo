| 8. STRETCH Correctly adds all supplyChanges together to equal 34               |     y     |
| 9. STRETCH Uses while loop to calculate 81 boxes filled, and 5 items remaining |     y     |

### Notes:

- Just a note on 'for...of' loops. It is general practice when iterating through an array to use a singular noun.
  'for (let changes of supplyChanges)'
  could rename to 'for (let change of supplyChanges) {...}'

  The code works, it is just helps with identifying the iterator is 'one' item.

## Feedback

- Good commits and commit messages! Formatting is good.

- Nice work reading the README.md file. You caught the changes needed to the style.css! It is not suppose to be a gotcha, but get into the habit of reading what is expected.

- Very clean looking code especially for problem #9. Well thought out and executed.

- Overall Great Work!
