## Feedback

- Read the "README.md" file carefully. Refer to `Files Provided` Section, and update the style.css file.

- Try committing changes more often. Small commits more often is a better practice than waiting and committing one, or two large commits. It allows to check less when looking back at what has changed in a file.

- Nice work!
