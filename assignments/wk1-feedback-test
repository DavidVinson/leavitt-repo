### Notes:

This is really good! I'd strongly recommend committing more often. Every time you get something new working (probably every 30 minutes or so), make a commit. You're saving your progress so that if something goes wrong, you can go back!

We also love giving feedback on things you are curious about, so feel free to throw questions you have into the comments on your assignment.

Great work!

## Feedback

### GitHub Config

Also note that your GitHub config is not correct. Here is an example from my personal setup.

```
git config --global user.name "mbMosman"
git config --global user.email "mbmosman@users.noreply.github.com"
```

Make sure to update this with both your GitHub username and the email GitHub has for you, as both must match for your commits to register correctly to your account. Then run the commands in the Mac terminal. If you use multiple computers, make sure to do this on each of them.

Once this is done you should see your profile image, not the GitHub Octocat icon, on new commits next to your name in the most recent commit (blue bar above the list of project files). Note that old commits won't change, but new ones should reflect the updated config. This is important for showing the work that you are doing on your GitHub profile. If you have any questions on this, Slack me and I'll help you out.
