### HTML

- when using a label in html, the 'for="carYear"' must match the 'id' attribute for which it is a label. for example, the 'input' element would have the 'id="carYear"', see below:

```html
<label for="carYear">Year:</label><br />
<input id="carYear" type="number" placeholder="Year of Car" /><br />
```

### CSS

- did not add a stylesheet.css; add some styling when you get a chance.

### JS

- I know you were pressed for time on this assignment. Overall, really nice work.
