## Feedback

- Get into a habit of making multiple commit messages! This is an awesome habit to build. Aim to make these commits more task specific, so the messages better reflect the changes made. Think about this more in terms of the functionality added or changed, not how much of the assignment is done. Examples might be: `Updated HTML & added styling`, `Added basic cart functionality`, or `Updated addItem to check if basket is full first`.
