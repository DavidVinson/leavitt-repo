## Feedback

- Nice work! It's good to go back and work with html and css. Soon, the javascript that you write will manipulate the DOM (document object model)

- Animations are great!

- The color gradient is a very nice touch, but beware of the text color used! Minor detail, but thought to point out.

- The styles.css is well contructed. Good use of class and targeting elements within the class. One of the entire points of css!

- Get into a habit of making smaller and more frequent commits! This is an awesome habit to build. Aim to make these commits more task specific, so the messages better reflect the changes made. Think about this more in terms of the functionality added or changed, not how much of the assignment is done. Examples might be: `Updated HTML & added styling`, `Added basic cart functionality`, or `Updated addItem to check if basket is full first`.
