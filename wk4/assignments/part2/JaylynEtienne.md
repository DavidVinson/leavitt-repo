## Feedback

- Exerpt from README.md: '''Now let's practice some CSS! For this, you will update the index.html file and create a new CSS Stylesheet.''' I see you made changes to the test.styles.css file; this file is not to be modified as it is not part of the assignment; it's there for testing purposes.

- The html is structured correctly, but formatting a document should be done on every assignment.

- Get into the the habit of making more frequent and smaller code commits. This is an awesome habit to build. Aim to make these commits more task specific, so the messages better reflect the changes made. Think about this more in terms of the functionality added or changed, not how much of the assignment is done. Examples might be: `Updated HTML & added styling`, `Added basic cart functionality`, or `Updated addItem to check if basket is full first`.
