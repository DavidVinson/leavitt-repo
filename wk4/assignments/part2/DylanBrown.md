## Feedback

- It's good to get back to html and css as we move into tying all the javascript into making a web page dynamic! Keep in mind good html structure and css.

- One div w/ class called "info" was to have a few child elements. The child elements of this div would have the necessary css applied. The image and h3 elements are outside of the div.

- In the stylesheet.css, what would you have to change for the header text to show? Black text on black background color is not the best idea!

- Images are tricky! Take some time to work through making an image stay within the bounds of the div. This is close, but not quite there.
