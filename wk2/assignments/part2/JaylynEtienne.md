### Notes:

- Q1: `if anything else besides Dane or Mary is set in the name variable, the page will ask, "how do you do?"`. This was close, but would only be correct `if anything else besides Mary...`.
- Q2: `the condition states that if the secret is set to super, the code value will multipky by 2`.

  - the if clause is `if (code === 123) {...}`
  - the condition is `(code === 123)`
    the code must first execute the condition. if the condition is true, then the code will execute the code block inside the "{...}" brackets. in this case, secret will be set to 'super' and as you mentioned code will be multiplied by 2.

- Q5: `We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 `

  - this is the statement that must be looked at a little closer. there is a logical operation that states what must happen for the if clause to be true.

- Q6: Good job on this one. use this example and take a look at those that were missed.

### Feedback

Please ask questions if you are having difficulty. I am being critical of the work submitted because I want you to get better. Fundamental concepts are being reinforced in tier 1 and tested with the exercises. Try to work through the concepts to understand not just to complete. I am here to help.
