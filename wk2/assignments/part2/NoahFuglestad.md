### Notes:

Q1: Good description of the code, but also needed to describe the code as it would run. ex, which console.log statement will executed?
Q2: Good description of the code. What would be the logged value of 'secret' if this code was executed?
Q3: Good description of the code. What would be the logged value if this code was executed?

Overall, the descriptions of the code was good. What was missing was describing what would happen if the code was executed.

### Resubmit work complete

- It takes some time to be able to "talk" through the code and predict what should be outcome if the code were to actually execute.
