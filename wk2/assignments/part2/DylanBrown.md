### Notes:

- Q2: when a variable is initialized like this: `let secret;` the value is 'undefined'. To set the value to null would be `let secret = null`.
- also, take another look at the second condition.
- Q6: the if statement matches the description. however, the results do not match. what could we do to fix the results to console.log the what is in the description?

Overall good work. There were some details that were missed, but I think you get the idea of logical operations and comparison operations. As a quick reference: [comparison operators]("https://www.codecademy.com/article/fwd-js-comparison-logical")
