### Notes:

- Good job on the descriptions

- Careful when checking to see if "types" match when you really want to check in the "value".

  - `Otherwise, we see if isStudent is the same variable type and is true`.
  - keep in mind the "type" of variable "isStudent" is a boolean. The "value" of the varible "isStudent" is true. So, type and value are not the same.

- Q6: I see where you going with this one, but it can be fixed by swapping out the console.log statements.
