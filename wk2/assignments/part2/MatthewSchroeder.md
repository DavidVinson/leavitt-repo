| Question 1 Description Accurate and correct value of console.log                  |     y     |
| Question 2 Description Accurate and correct value of console.log                  |     y     |
| Question 3 Description Accurate and correct value of console.log                  |     y     |
| Question 4 Found swapped values of `colorOne` and `colorTwo`                      |     y     |
| Question 4 Found Missing Assignment of `colorTwo`                                 |     y     |
| Question 5 Found logical error of OR instead of AND                               |     y     |
| Question 6 Swapped console.log statements (initially logs 'no entry' not 'enter') |     y     |

### Notes:

- Q6: the variables being declared as a 'let' or 'const' in this case are not a factor.
- Q6: since both variables are equal (value of 21) then the description says to console.log "enter". Then a direct way of fixing this issue is swapping the console.log statements.

### Feedback:

Overall good work. There were some details that were missed, but I think you get the idea of logical operations and comparison operations. As a quick reference: [comparison operators]("https://www.codecademy.com/article/fwd-js-comparison-logical")
