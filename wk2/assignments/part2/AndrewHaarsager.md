### Notes:

- Nice work on the logic descriptions.
- Very clear description of how the OR operator works in Q3. However, in the first condition, it would have been nice to see that same description provided for the AND operator. That both conditions have to be true for the statement to be true.
- That's a good way to look at the fix for Q6, but a more direct way without altering the if statement would be swapping the console.log statements.
