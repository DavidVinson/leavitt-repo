### Notes:

- Q2: Take another look at the second condition comparison operator
- Q3: Second condition comparison operator for age `else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) ...` does not match the provided description.

Overall good work. There were some details that were missed, but I think you get the idea of logical operations and comparison operations. As a quick reference: [comparison operators]("https://www.codecademy.com/article/fwd-js-comparison-logical")

### Resubmit work complete

- Takes a little time to learn to read code (mostly likely someone else's code) and understand what it is doing and what it should do. It's a journey!
