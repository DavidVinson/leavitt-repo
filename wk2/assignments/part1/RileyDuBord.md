### Notes:

- There are some details in the instructions that were missed in the aboutMe.js file. Fork and clone again without creating a new branch and take a look at the aboutMe.js file. There are 17 questions including stretch goals.

| General Items                  | Complete? |
| ------------------------------ | :-------: |
| The assignment repo was forked |     y     |
| The correct repo was turned in |     y     |
| GitHub config correct          |     y     |
| At least 2 commits             |     y     |
| Code is correctly formatted    |     y     |

---

### Notes:

- The correct Repo was forked and cloned, but then a "main" branch was created and did not contain some of the files needed for this assignment.

### Feedback:

- Get into a habit of formatting your files. html, css, and now .js files. If you format the aboutMe.js file, you will notice ";" semi-colons added to end of statements, and also some spacing around if/else statements. This may seem nitpicky, but want you to develop good habits. Overall, the readability of code matters and the code was pretty good, but formatting a file should be as common as saving a file. VS Code built in formatter: `Shift+Option+F`

### Resubmitted work

- Well done! this looks much better.
- the code is clean and organized (good formatting!!!)
- nice use of space between items
