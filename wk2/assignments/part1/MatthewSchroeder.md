### Notes:

- #12, #13: Look into the difference between varibble assignment and checking an equality condition; "=" vs. "===".

- #14: Look into the difference between "==" and "===" when checking an equality condition. Even though "==" is checking for equality, it is safter to use the strict "===".
  This may seem picky, but I would like to help point out a best practice to help develop better habits.

### Feedback:

- Get into a habit of formatting your files. html, css, and now .js files. If you format the aboutMe.js file, you will notice ";" semi-colons added to end of statements, and also some spacing around if/else statements. This may seem nitpicky, but want you to develop good habits. Overall, the readability of code matters and the code was pretty good, but formatting a file should be as common as saving a file.
