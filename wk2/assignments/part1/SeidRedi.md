### Feedback:

- Nice work! Having those automated test are wonderful for checking you work. Also, this was a good exercise in using comments to help describe what you want to do before writing any code.

- Very small inconsitencies in code format. Get into a habit of formatting your files. html, css, and now .js files. If you format the aboutMe.js file, you will notice ";" semi-colons added to end of statements, and also some spacing around if/else statements. This may seem nitpicky, but want you to develop good habits. Overall, the readability of code matters and the code was pretty good, but formatting a file should be as common as saving a file. VS Code built in formatter: `Shift+Option+F`
