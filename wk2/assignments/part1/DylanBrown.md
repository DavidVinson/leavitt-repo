### Notes:

- #12: Even though the console logs may be outputting the message you want, the idea is to change a variable, in this case "result" based on a condition "adventurous".

### Notes:

- The "aboutMe.js" file could use more consistent formatting.

### Feedback:

- Get into a habit of formatting your files. html, css, and now .js files. If you format the aboutMe.js file, you will notice ";" semi-colons added to end of statements, and also some spacing around if/else statements. This may seem nitpicky, but want you to develop good habits. Overall, the readability of code matters and the code was pretty good, but formatting a file should be as common as saving a file.

### Resubmit work complete

- Fomatting is better and corrected #12.
